  I want you to know how much fun their going to have while your away and there will be well taken care of! Caring for your pets will include greeting them, taking them out to the bathroom/walks/cleaning their litter or bedding, feeding them according to your instructions with fresh water, distribute any medications, followed by a fun play time as well as a final bathroom break before I depart. Each visit typically takes from 45 minutes to 1 hour unless instructed otherwise (additional time will be extra). Additional pet taxi will counts as 1 day visit ($20).
